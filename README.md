# slicer

Slicer is a tool designed to automate the processing of audio files. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Provide the file directory, and slicer will initialize the process.
2. **Resampling**: It ensures that the audio files are resampled to 48 kHz, converting any 44.1 kHz files commonly outputted by UVR.
3. **Transcription and Rough Cut**: Runs `faster-whisper` via `whisper.py`, preconfigured to load the `large-v2` model (can be changed on line 38 of `whisper.py`). It transcribes the audio and makes a rough cut into sections.
4. **Segment Splitting**: Lastly, it executes `split.py` to ensure that all segments follow the 1-3.7s rule, skipping preprocessing in variants of the RVC WebUI.
